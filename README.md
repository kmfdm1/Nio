About NIO (the happy celtic one)
===============

NIO is a implementation of a java.nio "framework" easing the implementation of everything possible with tcp.

It contains a reference-implementation of a realy basic HTTP-Server which only responds with the header-fields the client sent.
The only purpose of this HTTP-Server is to show how Poller and MultithreadedPoller may be put to use by just implementing your own IOHandler.

Status

Very very early and basic :)
